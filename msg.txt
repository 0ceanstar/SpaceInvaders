Refactored client side

The Client is able to perform basic tcp data exchange.
I contributed to and updated the exception package, now each one has two constructors.
The model and the networking part are more separated now.
Client Config is now a singleton.
ErrorsEnum has been eliminated, only exceptions are being used now.
Logging was added.
The Command package was started.
